         <h3>18th/19th century Sweden</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 500;" > After the death of the warrior king Karl XII in 1718 and Sweden’s defeat in the Great Northern War, the Swedish parliament 
                (Riksdag) and council were strong enough to introduce a new constitution that abolished royal absolutism and put power in 
                the hands of parliament.Eighteenth-century Sweden was characterised by rapid cultural development, partly through close 
                contact with France. Overseas trade was hard hit by the Napoleonic Wars, which led to general stagnation and economic crisis 
                in Sweden during the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, 90 per cent of the people still earned their livelihoods 
                from agriculture. One consequence was emigration, mainly to North America. From the mid-19th century to 1930, 
                about 1.5 million Swedes emigrated, out of a population of 3.5 million in 1850 and slightly more than 6 million in 1930. Industry 
                did not begin to grow until the 1890s, although it then developed rapidly between 1900 and 1930 and transformed Sweden into one of 
                Europe’s leading industrial nations after World War II.</p>
          

           
                <h3>The 20th century – a century of reforms</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 500;">Late 19th-century Sweden was marked by the emergence of strong popular movements that included the free churches, 
                the temperance and women’s movements, and above all the labour movement.The labour movement, whose growth kept pace with 
                industrialization in the late 19th century, was reformist in outlook after the turn of the 20th century.The first Social 
                Democrats entered government in 1917. Universal suffrage was introduced for men in 1909 and for women in 1921. Plans for a 
                welfare state were drawn up during the 1930s after the Social Democrats rose to power, and put into effect after World War II.
                </p>
               <h3>The postwar era</h3> 
               <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 500;">
               During World War II, a coalition of Sweden’s four ‘democratic’ parties (excluding the Communists) formed the government. 
               After the war ended, a purely Social Democratic government resumed office under Per Albin Hansson. Under Social Democratic 
               leadership, but in close co-operation with the other democratic parties, a series of reforms were carried out in the 1940s 
               and 1950s that together laid the foundations of the Swedish welfare state. At the same time, there were calls for a 
               modernization of the 1809 constitution. A new Instrument of Government was adopted in 1974, stating that all public power 
               is derived from the people, who are to select the members of parliament in free elections. The monarch is still the head of 
               state, but in name only. In 1979, an amendment to the order of succession gave male and female heirs an equal claim to the 
               throne. Accordingly, Crown Princess Victoria is next in line to the throne, not her younger brother, Carl Philip.
               </p>
              <h3>Foreign policy</h3>
              <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 500;">
              Since a short war against Norway in 1814 in conjunction with the creation of the union, Sweden has not been involved in any war. 
              Since World War I, Sweden has pursued a policy of non-alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime, basing its security on a strong 
              national defense. Nonetheless, Sweden joined the League of Nations in 1920 and the United Nations in 1946. The first UN operation 
              involving Swedish troops took place in Suez in 1956. Since 1994, Sweden has also co-operated with Nato under the Partnership for Peace. 
              Through these organisations, Sweden has been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions.

                <strong>Education in Sweden</strong> is mandatory for children between ages 7 and 15. The school year in Sweden runs from mid/late August 
                to early/mid June. The Christmas holiday from mid December to early January divides the Swedish school year into two terms.
                Preschool is free for low-income families and subsidized with a price ceiling for all families. The year children turn six 
                they start the compulsory preschool class (förskoleklass), which act as a transition phase between preschool and comprehensive schools. 
                Children between ages 7 and 15 attend comprehensive school where a wide range of subjects are studied. All students study the same subjects, 
                with exception for different language choices. The majority of schools are run municipally, but there are also privately owned schools,
                known as independent schools.Almost all students continue studying in 3 year long upper secondary schools where most students 
                choose one out of 18 national programmes some of which are vocational and some preparatory. For students not fulfilling the requirements
                for the national programmes, introductory programmes are available where students work to satisfy the requirements for the national 
                programmes. In 2018, 16% of students finishing year 9 of comprehensive school were not eligible for national programmes.
                The higher education system is compatible with the rest of Europe through the Bologna Process where degrees are divided 
                into 3 cycles, basic level, advanced level and doctoral level. There are two degrees available in each cycle of different 
                lengths. Universities have no tuition fees for Swedish citizens (as well for citizens of European Economic Area сountries),
                and student aid is available from the government.
                </p>
               
        
               <h4>Upper Secondary education</h4>
               <p class="parOne">
               Upper Secondary school, called gymnasieskola, usually lasts for three years. It's elective, but with a 99% enrollment rate 
               (OECD 2018).It is divided into 18 different national programmes with different educational focus.The system is course based 
               with the same courses being used for multiple programmes. There are also introductory programmes for students who don't 
               satisfy the requirements for the national programmes. A significant number of these students are immigrants learning Swedish.
               <br>
               <strong>National programmes:</strong>
               The national programmes are divided into two categories: preparatory and vocational. All national programmes give basic 
               qualification to attend university,[51] but preparatory programs typically also satisfy the additional requirements needed 
               to study university courses in specific subject areas.In 2018 approximately one third of students studying a national 
               programme were studying a vocational programme while two thirds were studying a preparatory programme.
